In those exercises, I tried fitting GARCH family model into provided dataset consisting of Gold and Platinium returns. After that, I compared the efficiency of models using the Log Likelihood Ratio or other criteria such as calculating AIC or BIC. Moreover, I also calculated the VaR for each model. 

Finally, I did backtesting by using statistical tests such as Kupiec or Christoffersen tests and tried forecast out-of-sample values.
